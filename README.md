This repository comprises of my coursework software programs under the course 8051 Microcontroller Assembly Level Language Programming.

General Introduction -
       8051 Architecture:
Architecture shows usual CPU components such as Program counter (PC),
ALU, working registers and clock circuits.
Features:
• 8 bit CPU with registers A (Accumulator) & B
• 16 bit program counter (PC) and Data pointer (DPTR).
• 8 bit Program status word (PSW).
• 8 bit stack pointer.
• Internal ROM of 4kbytes.
• Internal RAM of 128 bytes.
• 4 register banks each containing 8 registers.
• 16 bytes of bit addressable registers.
• 8 bytes of general purpose data memory.
• 32 I/O pins arranged in four 8 pin ports (P0 to P3).
• Two 16 bit Timer/Counter (T0 & T1).
• Full duplex serial data receiver / transmitter (SBUF).

• Control registers, TCON, TMOD, SCON, PCON, IP & IE.
• 2 external & 3 internal interrupt source.
• Oscillator and clock circuits
